    "# **Local Host Security Scan**\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "This project is a quick **Nmap scan** of the **localhost (127.0.0.1)** to identify open ports and active services running on the machine.  \n",
    "It simulates a **real-world use case** where a cybersecurity practitioner periodically checks their system for unexpected services or suspicious activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Perform a Local Host Security Scan?**\n",
    "1. **Routine Security Check** – Ensure only necessary services are running and no unexpected open ports exist.  \n",
    "2. **Troubleshooting & Diagnostics** – Verify if required services (e.g., SSH, RDP, web servers) are active.  \n",
    "3. **Incident Response** – Investigate potential **malware activity** or unauthorized access if something seems unusual (e.g., sluggish system, strange connections).  \n",

    "## **Project Steps**\n",
    "### **1️⃣ Set Up the Environment**\n",
    "- Open **VS Code with Jupyter Notebook**.\n",
    "- Create a new notebook for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Run the Localhost Nmap Scan**\n",
    "- Perform a full port scan on localhost:\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, perform a quicker scan on common ports:\n",
    "nmap -p 22,80,443,3389 127.0.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Analyze the Results\n",
    "Identify any unexpected open ports.\n",
    "Determine what services are running.\n",
    "If necessary, investigate whether these services should be active.\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ Document Findings\n",
    "Summarize the scan results in the notebook.\n",
    "Provide an analysis of any unexpected findings.\n",
    "Discuss potential next steps (e.g., closing unnecessary ports, investigating unknown services).\n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣\n",
    "Expected Outcome\n",
    "A documented quick security check of the local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps (Optional)\n",
    "Run periodic scans as part of routine security.\n",
    "Investigate any unexpected services and disable unnecessary ones.\n",
    "Expand on this by scanning other devices on the network."
